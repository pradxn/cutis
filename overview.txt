------------------------------Main Idea------------------------------

EWG but for India

https://www.ewg.org/sunscreen/about-the-sunscreens/1020664/Neogen_Dermalogy_Day-light_Protection_Airy_Sunscreen%2C_SPF_50/

Main idea of this platform is this make users enter their SPF and 
Moisturizer name, then we would process it and give them if it contains some
harmful ingredients for skin or blood

eg: if a product contains retinol: display a disclaimer that pregnent women
and lacting mothers should not use it

------------------------------Website UI rough idea------------------

1. enter / select your product name

2. we will display if it has any harmful content or grade them
one way:
    A+ -> has no harmful ingredients OR whatever it has is negligible / ineffective
    A -> has 1-2 harmful ingredients OR whatever it has is negligible in a way
    B -> has 3 harmful ingredients OR whatever it has is damaging
    C -> has 4 harmful ingredients OR whatever it has is damaging in long term
    D -> has 5 harmful ingredients OR whatever it has is harmful
    F -> has 5< harmful ingredients OR harmful af
another way:
    0-10: based on harmone disrupting chemicals, cancer causing agents,
    skin allergies, and also consider UVA & UVB protection rating and
    misleading claims by manufacturer and based on long term exposure to
    some ingredients
    
3. a page where we display A+ products

4. also make blogs on skin-care, collab with dermatologists, ideal ranges
for each ingredients for general skin unless recommended by dermatologists
eg: niacinaminde ideal range is 2%-5%

5. FUTURE: select your skin concern and get recommended products or ingredients

--------------------------------Money--------------------------------

1. Advertising
2. Freemium: make this as an API so someone can use it in their project
3. Marketing: selling other better products
4. Data-Mining: users data for third-parties for marketing, only email
5. Donations: donate to website development
6. Sponsorships

--------------------------------Tech---------------------------------

HTML & MERN: front-end and databases
Python: for scanning data and adding it to databases
JS: for API

try AWS Textract for extracting data, if it costs alot, then make
an algorithm for extracting data from an image

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. select your spf/moisturizer
2. results will be displayed with product picture, full name, its grade, and 
toxic chemicals list: ingredients and their harmful effects

working:
1. every product has a separate document, compare those with another document which contains toxic 
ingredients lists

product-1: {a,b,c,d}
product-2: {a,b,d,e}
toxic: {c,t,g}

return found {c}, and what it causes to skin

2. all products are in a single document like document[product] -> compare it with another document containing
toxic chemicals list & return whatever is matched
